I promise that this Agreement does not conflict with any other contract, agreement or understanding to which I am a party. Finally, I promise that I’ll hold and maintain in strict confidence any confidential information that you provide me (such as proprietary technical or business information), and I will not disclose such information to any third party except as may be required by a court or governmental authority. 

**5. Training.** The Fee you’ll pay me for this project includes ``Number of training hours`` hours of training in the use of the software I create for you.
